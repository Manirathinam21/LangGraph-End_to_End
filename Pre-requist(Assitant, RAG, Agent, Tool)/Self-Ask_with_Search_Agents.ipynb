    "### Self-Ask with Search Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This approach allows the AI to ask itself follwo-up questions when it doesn't immediately know the answer. it performs a recursive questioning process to breakdown complete queries into smaller, more manageable ones.\n",
    "- Once the AI generates these follow-up questions, it performs an external search(e.g. through google or an internal database) to gather the necessary information before formulating the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Receive a complex questions\n",
    "- Step 2: The agents identifies sub-questions or follow-up questions\n",
    "- Step 3: It promotes a search or fetches answers to these questions from external resources (like a web search) \n",
    "- Step 4: The answers are aggregated to provide a complete response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Emphasizes question decomposition\n",
    "- Relies in external search for sub-questions.\n",
    "- Useful for answering open-ended or broad questions when the answer is not immediately available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- original question:\"How many moons does jupiter have?\"\n",
    "- sub-question: \"what is jupiter?\"(search)\n",
    "- sub-question: \"what is moons?\"(search)\n",
    "- Finally, it retrieves the answer:\"Jupiter has 79 moons\""
