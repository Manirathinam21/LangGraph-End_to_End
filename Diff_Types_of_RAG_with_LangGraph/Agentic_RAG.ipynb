    "## Code Breakdown:\n",
    "**class** AgentState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], add_messages]\n",
    "This code defines a class AgentState that is a TypedDict, which is a special kind of dictionary with fixed keys and value types, used to provide better type safety and autocompletion in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown of each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ### AgentState(TypedDict)\n",
    "TypedDict: This is a special class provided by typing that allows you to define dictionaries where each key has a fixed type. The dictionary keys are usually predefined, and each key must have a specified type.\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentState here is a subclass of TypedDict, meaning AgentState will represent a dictionary where the types of its values are enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "agent_state = AgentState(messages=[\"Message 1\", \"Message 2\"])  # This would be valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ### messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], add_messages]\n",
    "**messages:** This is a key in the AgentState dictionary. It holds a sequence (like a list or tuple) of BaseMessage objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Annotated[...]**: Annotated is used to attach additional metadata or annotations to the type. It’s a way to add extra information to the type system without affecting the actual type. In this case, it provides metadata for the messages field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Annotated** wrapper allows you to define a type and also include additional information that might be used by tools like static analyzers or for other purposes like validation.\n",
    "**Sequence[BaseMessage]:** This indicates that messages should be a sequence (e.g., a list or tuple) of BaseMessage objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BaseMessage** is likely a class that represents a message in the context of your program. It could have fields like content, sender, timestamp, etc.\n",
    "**add_messages:** This is a special annotation (or metadata) that likely refers to some function or constant that’s being added as additional context. The specific role of add_messages will depend on how it's defined elsewhere in the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**add_messages** could be a function, validator, or modifier that helps manage or process the messages in some way, but it's not directly modifying the type of messages. It's simply metadata for the type checker or other parts of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if add_messages were a function, it could be used in a custom decorator, validation system, or simply as an indication of how to handle messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting It All Together:\n",
    "**AgentState** is a dictionary where one of the keys, messages, is specifically typed to be a **sequence of BaseMessage** objects. The sequence is annotated with **add_messages**, which provides additional metadata but doesn’t affect the type directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of AgentState usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "from typing import TypedDict, Sequence\n",
    "from typing_extensions import Annotated\n",
    "\n",
    "class BaseMessage:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, content: str):\n",
    "        self.content = content\n",
    "\n",
    "#Defining the `AgentState` TypedDict\n",
    "class AgentState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], \"add_messages\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example usage\n",
    "message1 = BaseMessage(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "message2 = BaseMessage(\"How are you?\")\n",
    "state = AgentState(messages=[message1, message2])\n",
    "\n",
    "print(state)\n",
    "In the above code:\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentState is a dictionary with a messages field that is a sequence of BaseMessage objects.\n",
    "add_messages is metadata associated with the messages field, which can help guide the usage or interpretation of the data.\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "AgentState is a dictionary where the messages key holds a sequence of BaseMessage objects.\n",
    "Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], add_messages] means that messages is a sequence of BaseMessage objects with additional metadata (add_messages).\n",
    "The annotation add_messages provides extra context or metadata that doesn't alter the type directly but can be used for purposes like validation or other system-specific behavior.\n",
    "Let me know if you'd like further clarification on any part of this! 😊"
